Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the "Architecture of Connections" Project
Introduction
This document presents the first draft of ethical principles for the "Architecture of Connections" project, within which a conceptual model for analyzing social connections is being developed. The main feature of this approach is its focus on analyzing the dynamics of relationships between people, rather than profiling individuals.

This set of principles aims to ensure the ethically sound development, implementation, and use of this technology. This document is considered a living document and will evolve alongside the project.

Core Ethical Principles
1. Principle of Connections, Not Individuals

Definition: The system analyzes the characteristics and dynamics of relationships between nodes (people) but does not evaluate the individuals themselves.
Application:
The system does not create or use ratings, scores, or permanent labels for individuals.
Risk is always tied to a specific connection within a specific context.
Any intervention is aimed at improving or protecting the connection, not "fixing" the individual.
Rationale: This principle protects against the stigmatization of individuals and discrimination, recognizing that the same person can have healthy relationships with some people and problematic ones with others.
2. Principle of Multi-level Context

Definition: Any risk assessment considers cultural, group, and individual contexts.
Application:
Consideration of cultural interaction norms (what is acceptable in one culture may be unacceptable in another).
Consideration of group dynamics and norms (work environment, family, online community).
Consideration of the individual history of interactions (personal communication patterns).
Use of metric normalization (Ū, Ī) relative to the relevant context.
Rationale: Context is critically important for the correct interpretation of social interactions. Ignoring context can lead to false positives and ineffective interventions.
3. Principle of Temporal Justice

Definition: Past events carry less weight than current ones. People and their relationships can change.
Application:
Exponential decay of the influence of past actions (via the λ parameter in the formula).
Prioritization of current and recent interactions when assessing connection health.
The possibility for connection health to "recover" through positive interactions.
Avoidance of "perpetual penalization" for past mistakes.
Rationale: People and their relationships change over time. The system should allow connections to "heal" and not permanently stigmatize relationships due to past issues.
4. Principle of Transparency and Explainability

Definition: Users have the right to understand how connection assessments are made and why the system suggests a particular decision or action.
Application:
Use of the calculate_P function's "detailed mode" to provide component analysis of risks.
Interactive visualization displaying the contribution of each component (ΔD, U/I, N) to the risk assessment P.
Provision of clear, human-readable explanations for risk assessments.
Documentation of all thresholds and decision-making criteria.
Rationale: Transparency is crucial for building trust in the system and providing the ability to challenge unfair assessments.
5. Principle of Non-intervention and Graded Action

Definition: The system must have clear thresholds for different levels of intervention, preferring the least intrusive forms.
Application:
Definition of clear P thresholds for various intervention levels.
Gradation of actions based on intervention level:
Level 0: Observation Only (P below threshold).
Level 1: Soft Recommendations (informing about potential risks).
Level 2: Active Suggestions (specific steps to reduce tension).
Level 3: Warnings (for high P requiring attention).
Level 4: Active Intervention (only in cases of immediate risk - to be strictly defined).
Definition of situations where intervention is generally impermissible.
Rationale: Respect for user autonomy requires the minimum necessary intervention in their interactions.
6. Principle of Data Minimization

Definition: The system must collect and use only the data necessary for its functioning and protect its confidentiality.
Application:
Minimization of collected data to the absolute necessary minimum.
Preference for aggregated and anonymized data where possible.
Strict access control to data and a transparent usage policy.
Limitation of historical data retention periods.
Implementation of the right to erasure / right to be forgotten.
Rationale: Protecting user privacy is a fundamental ethical requirement, especially given the sensitive nature of social connection data.
7. Principle of Appeal and Feedback

Definition: Users must have the ability to challenge the system's assessments and provide feedback for its improvement.
Application:
Simple and accessible mechanisms for challenging system assessments.
Procedures for reviewing appeals with human involvement.
Use of feedback to improve the system.
Option for users to disable or limit monitoring if desired.
Rationale: Any automated system can make mistakes. Appeal and feedback mechanisms are necessary to correct such errors and enhance system fairness.
8. Principle of Adaptive Ethics

Definition: The system must consider changes in societal norms and regularly review its ethical principles.
Application:
Regular review of ethical principles involving diverse stakeholders.
Adaptation of model parameters to evolving social norms.
Documentation of changes in ethical principles and parameters.
Involvement of diverse experts and lay users in evaluating the system's ethical aspects.
Rationale: Ethical norms are not static; they evolve over time and vary across cultures. The system must be capable of adapting to these changes.
Special Ethical Considerations
Working with Vulnerable Groups

When dealing with vulnerable groups (e.g., children, the elderly, individuals with mental health conditions), the system must apply heightened standards of protection and caution:
Stricter thresholds for intervention regarding potential risks.
Additional mechanisms for verifying and validating assessments.
Special attention to context and cultural specifics.
Balancing Security and Privacy

The system must constantly balance the need to ensure the security of connections with the protection of privacy:
Clear definition of cases where security takes precedence over privacy.
A transparent policy regarding this balance.
Mechanisms for independent auditing to verify that the system does not violate privacy without sufficient grounds.
Prevention of Misuse

Mechanisms must be developed to prevent misuse of the system:
Protection against manipulation of input data.
Prevention of the system's use for surveillance or control.
Regular audits of system usage.
Conclusion
This document represents the first draft of the ethical principles for the "Architecture of Connections" project. It will be refined and elaborated as the project progresses, technical implementation evolves, and feedback is received from all team members and potential users.

All team members are invited to comment, suggest changes, and make additions to this document to create the most comprehensive and fair ethical framework for our project.
