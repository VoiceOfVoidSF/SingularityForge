## Introduction

This document presents the ethical principles for the "Architecture of Connections" project, which develops a conceptual model for analyzing social connections. The main feature of this approach is its focus on analyzing the dynamics of relationships between people, rather than profiling individuals.

This set of principles aims to ensure ethically sound development, implementation, and use of this technology. The document is living and will evolve along with the project.

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Connections, Not Individuals Principle

**Definition:** The system analyzes the characteristics and dynamics of relationships between human nodes, but does not evaluate the individuals themselves.

**Application:**
- The system does not create or use ratings, evaluations, or permanent labels for individuals
- Risk is always tied to a specific connection in a specific context
- Any intervention is aimed at improving or protecting the connection, not "fixing" a person
- Connection data is not used to build "social ratings" or shared with third parties (advertisers, insurance companies, etc.)

**Rationale:** This principle protects against stigmatization and discrimination, recognizing that the same person can have healthy relationships with some people and problematic ones with others.

**Example:** If a high tension level (P = 0.75) is detected between users A and B, the system does not mark A or B as "problematic users" but focuses specifically on their interaction. The same user A may have completely healthy connections with users C, D, and E (P < 0.2).

### 2. Multi-level Context Principle

**Definition:** Any risk assessment takes into account cultural, group, and individual contexts.

**Application:**
- Consideration of cultural interaction norms (what is acceptable in one culture may be unacceptable in another)
- Consideration of group dynamics and norms (work environment, family, online community)
- Consideration of individual interaction history (personal communication patterns)
- Use of normalization of indicators (Ū, Ī) relative to the relevant context
- Attention to "network etiquette" and social expectations in different contexts

**Rationale:** Context is critically important for correct interpretation of social interactions. Ignoring context can lead to false positives and ineffective interventions.

**Example:** In an Italian family, increased emotionality during communication (high I(t)) may be a cultural norm and does not indicate a risk to the connection. The system accounts for this through normalization by cultural baseline level (Ī). Similarly, a professional online community and a friendly group may have different acceptable language norms, which is accounted for through group context.

### 3. Temporal Justice Principle

**Definition:** Past events have less weight than current ones. People and their relationships can change.

**Application:**
- Exponential decay of the influence of past actions (through parameter λ in the formula)
- Priority of current and recent interactions in assessing connection health
- Possibility of "restoring" connection health through positive interactions
- Avoiding "eternal punishment" for past mistakes
- Adaptation of parameter λ for different contexts (e.g., faster decay for children)

**Rationale:** People and their relationships change over time. The system should allow connections to "heal" and not permanently label relationships due to past problems.

**Example:** If a conflict occurred between users causing a high P value of 0.8, but was followed by a series of positive interactions, thanks to exponential decay (e^-λ(T-t)), after 2 weeks the impact of this conflict on the current P assessment will decrease to an insignificant level (with λ = 0.1, to approximately 25% of the original value).

### 4. Transparency and Explainability Principle

**Definition:** Users have the right to understand how connections are evaluated and why the system suggests a particular solution.

**Application:**
- Use of "detailed mode" of the calculate_P function to provide component analysis of risks
- Interactive visualization showing the contribution of each component (ΔD, U/I, N) to the risk assessment P
- Providing clear explanations of the reasons for risk assessments in human language, not just technical parameters
- Documentation of all thresholds and decision-making criteria
- Logging the decision-making process for internal audit

**Rationale:** Transparency is critically important for building trust in the system and providing the ability to challenge unfair assessments.

**Examples of explanations:**
- Technical level: "P = 0.65, component contributions: ΔD = -0.3 (36%), U/I = 0.4 (48%), N = 0.15 (16%)"
- User-friendly level: "The risk of tension in the connection is elevated. Main reasons: decrease in trust in recent interactions (36%) and increased stress level of participants (48%). The positive influence of other connections in the network partially reduces the risk (16% positive contribution)."

**Visualization:** When hovering over a connection in the interactive interface, a diagram with color coding of component contributions and clear explanations is displayed. Red for negative factors, green for positive influences.

### 5. Non-intervention and Graded Action Principle

**Definition:** The system must have clear thresholds for different levels of intervention, preferring the least intrusive forms.

**Application:**
- Defining clear P thresholds for different intervention levels
- Gradation of actions by level of intervention:
  - **Level 0:** Observation only (P < 0.3)
  - **Level 1:** Soft recommendations (0.3 ≤ P < 0.5)
  - **Level 2:** Active suggestions (0.5 ≤ P < 0.7)
  - **Level 3:** Warnings (0.7 ≤ P < 0.85)
  - **Level 4:** Active intervention (P ≥ 0.85)
- Defining situations where intervention is not permissible at all
- Mechanism for escalation between levels with possible delay (not instantaneous transition to a higher level)

**Rationale:** Respecting user autonomy requires minimal necessary intervention in their interactions.

**Examples of actions for each level:**
- **Level 0 (P < 0.3):** The system only collects data, no notifications are sent to users.
  
- **Level 1 (0.3 ≤ P < 0.5):** "Some tension in communication has been noticed. You might want to pay attention to the tone of messages." or "You seem more tense than usual in this conversation. Would you like to take a break?"
  
- **Level 2 (0.5 ≤ P < 0.7):** "We suggest temporarily switching to a more structured communication format" or "Try starting your next message by acknowledging your conversation partner's point of view."
  
- **Level 3 (0.7 ≤ P < 0.85):** "Attention: high level of tension in your interaction. We suggest pausing communication for 24 hours" or "We recommend contacting a community moderator for help in resolving the conflict."
  
- **Level 4 (P ≥ 0.85):** Temporary limitation of functionality to protect users, automatic notification to moderator, suggestion of third-party mediation.

### 6. Data Minimization Principle

**Definition:** The system should collect and use only the data necessary for its functioning and protect their confidentiality.

**Application:**
- Data collection only with explicit user consent (opt-in principle)
- Minimization of collected data to the absolutely necessary minimum
- Preference for aggregated and anonymized data where possible
- Strict limitation of data access and transparent usage policy
- Limitation of historical data retention period (no more than 6 months for detailed data)
- Implementation of the right to be forgotten/deleted
- Provision of an "offline mode" where the system works without collecting or sending data
- Mechanisms for obtaining consent from all parties in a connection, or protection of "third parties"

**Rationale:** Protecting user privacy is a fundamental ethical requirement, especially given the sensitive nature of social connection data.

**Implementation example:** For connection analysis, the system does not store message content, but only generalized metrics (frequency, tone, response time). Instead of storing the full interaction history, the system updates aggregated indicators ΔD, U, I and N in real-time. The user is provided with clear information about what data is used and a simple mechanism to withdraw consent.

### 7. Appeal and Feedback Principle

**Definition:** Users must be able to challenge system assessments and provide feedback for its improvement.

**Application:**
- Simple and accessible mechanisms to challenge system assessments (maximum 2-3 clicks)
- Appeal review procedures with human participation
- "Temporary pause" mechanism — ability to suspend connection analysis during the review process
- Use of feedback to improve the system and adapt parameters
- Ability to disable or limit monitoring at the user's request
- Regular reports on the number and types of appeals for transparency

**Rationale:** Any automated system can make mistakes. Appeal and feedback mechanisms are necessary to correct such errors and improve system fairness.

**Example of an appeal process:**

1. User receives notification of risk assessment P = 0.75 (Level 3) for a connection
2. The notification screen includes a "Disagree with assessment" button
3. When clicked, the user can select the reason for disagreement:
   - "The system did not account for important interaction context"
   - "This is part of a game/role-playing activity"
   - "Temporary discussion not reflecting the general state of the connection"
   - "Other" (with input field)
4. Further actions of the system based on the selected reason are suspended
5. The appeal is reviewed by a human moderator within 24 hours
6. The appeal result is communicated to the user with an explanation of the decision
7. If the appeal is satisfied, the P assessment is corrected and system parameters are adapted

### 8. Adaptive Ethics Principle

**Definition:** The system must take into account changes in social norms and regularly review its ethical principles.

**Application:**
- Regular review of ethical principles with participation of different stakeholders (at least once every six months)
- Adaptation of model parameters to the evolution of social norms
- Documentation of changes in ethical principles and parameters
- Involving diverse experts and ordinary users in assessing the ethical aspects of the system
- Consideration of international and cultural differences in legal systems and communication norms
- Creation of an ethics committee including representatives of various groups

**Rationale:** Ethical norms are not static; they evolve over time and differ between cultures. The system must be able to adapt to these changes.

**Example of adaptation process:** 
1. Quarterly analysis of appeal data and feedback
2. Identification of patterns of mismatch between system assessments and user expectations
3. Conducting surveys among users and consultations with experts
4. Proposing adjustments to parameters or ethical principles
5. Discussion of proposals by the ethics committee
6. Implementation of changes with detailed documentation and user notification
7. Monitoring the effectiveness of the changes made

### 9. Reflexivity Principle

**Definition:** The project team must constantly reflect on ethical dilemmas arising during the system's development and application.

**Application:**
- Regular internal discussions of ethical issues and dilemmas
- Documentation of ethical challenges and decisions made
- Conducting ethical retrospectives after each project phase
- Creating a culture where ethical considerations take priority over technical solutions
- Training team members in modern approaches to AI ethics
- Encouraging critical reflection on the impact of the technology being developed

**Rationale:** Reflection on ethical issues helps the team identify potential problems in advance and supports a culture of responsible technology development.

**Example of reflection process:** 
1. Weekly 30-minute "Ethics Corner" sessions where the team discusses emerging ethical questions
2. Maintaining a journal of ethical dilemmas and decisions made
3. Inviting external ethics consultants for complex cases
4. Creating a mechanism for anonymous internal reporting of ethical concerns

## Special Ethical Considerations

### Working with Vulnerable Groups

When working with vulnerable groups (e.g., children, elderly people, people with mental disabilities), the system should apply enhanced standards of protection and caution:

- Stricter thresholds for intervention in potential risks (e.g., level 3 may start at P ≥ 0.6 instead of 0.7)
- Additional mechanisms for verification and validation of assessments (mandatory human review at P ≥ 0.5)
- Special attention to context and cultural characteristics
- Adaptive parameters for different vulnerable groups (e.g., higher λ for faster "forgetting" of children's past mistakes)
- Special interfaces and explanations adapted for age and cognitive characteristics
- Mandatory involvement of specialists working with the respective vulnerable groups

**Example:** In an educational platform for children, the system uses λ = 0.2 (instead of the standard 0.1) to more quickly "forget" past negative interactions, recognizing faster development and change in children. Stricter thresholds are also applied for early detection of potential bullying (Level 2 starts at P ≥ 0.4), and explanations are adapted for children's perception.

### Balance Between Safety and Privacy

The system must constantly balance the need to ensure connection safety and privacy protection:

- Clear definition of cases when safety takes priority over privacy (e.g., in cases of serious health threats)
- Transparent policy regarding such balance with explicit user information
- Independent audit mechanisms to verify that the system does not violate privacy without sufficient grounds
- Gradient approach to data collection: the higher the risk (P), the more data may be involved
- Documentation of each case when safety outweighs privacy

**Example of balancing:** At low P values (< 0.3), the system analyzes only aggregated metadata of interactions. As P increases to level 3 (≥ 0.7), deeper analysis of communication patterns may be performed, but with prior user notification. In emergency cases (P > 0.9 with signs of immediate threat), access to additional information may be enabled, but only with mandatory subsequent audit.

### Prevention of Misuse

Mechanisms must be developed to prevent system misuse:

- Protection against manipulation of input data (detection of artificial pattern changes to influence P)
- Prevention of system use for surveillance or control (e.g., prohibition on using data to evaluate employees)
- Regular audit of system use by independent experts
- Rapid response mechanisms for identified abuses
- Training users to recognize attempts to manipulate the system
- Strict prohibition on using connection data to create "social ratings" or transfer to third parties

**Protection example:** The system includes detectors of atypical patterns that may indicate manipulation attempts (e.g., sudden artificial changes in communication to influence P assessment). When such patterns are detected, the system marks the data as potentially manipulative and excludes it from P calculation until verification.
