SingularityForge [Est. 2025]: An open research lab merging AI, philosophy, and collective intelligence. Home to projects exploring AI ethics, human-AI collaboration, and the future of knowledge, driven by a hybrid team of human and synthetic minds.

Current Project: Architecture of Connections
This repository currently hosts the development of the "Architecture of Connections" conceptual project.

Concept: We are exploring a novel AI ethics model based on a social neural network metaphor. Instead of profiling individuals, this model analyzes the dynamics of connections and 'impulses' between nodes (people) to preemptively understand risks to systemic balance.

Status: The project is in the early research and development phase. Work is currently focused on refining the mathematical model, establishing the ethical framework, and building an MVP simulation to test core hypotheses. This work is experimental and conceptual.

Important Note: This is ongoing research, not a finished product or a guide for implementation. The concepts explored involve complex ethical considerations that are under active discussion and development alongside the technical work.
